# Prison System
This project is a Prison System developed in Python using the tkinter library for the user interface and SQLite3 for the database. It provides basic functionality for managing prisoner data, including adding, deleting, updating, and printing prisoner information as an Excel file.

# Features
The Prison System has the following features:

- Add new prisoners to the system by entering their personal details, such as name, age, crime, and sentence length.
- Update prisoner information, such as sentence length or release date, in the database.
- Delete prisoners from the system if they are no longer incarcerated.
- Print prisoner data as an Excel file, which can be used for further analysis or reporting.

# Installation
To run the Prison System, you will need to have Python 3 and the tkinter and SQLite3 libraries installed on your system. You can install these libraries using the following commands:

pip install tkinter

pip install sqlite3

After installing the libraries, you can download the project files from GitHub and run the 'main.py' file.


# Usage
To use the Prison System, simply open the 'main.py' file in Python and follow the instructions provided in the user interface. You can add, update, or delete prisoners as needed, and export the data as an Excel file for further analysis.
